Persona: A visually impaired mathematics student

Questions:
	1) What accesibility features would you want in a scientific calculator software (eg., enlarged buttons, text to speech, colour custimization, etc.)?
	2) Would a keyboard-shortcut enabled toggle be the best way to enable these accesibility features (ex: ctrl + a to open accesibility settings)?
	3) How should input errors be conveyed to the impaired user (eg., voice, buzzer, etc.)?
